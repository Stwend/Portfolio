                            Hi! <br> I'm Stefan, a 3D Artist and programmer based in Munich. 
                            In 2015, I graduated at the University of Augsburg with a B.Sc. in Computer Science & Multimedia - way before that, I started teaching myself how to do everything related to 3D models. <br><br>
                            Since my graduation I've worked as a 3D Artist at Dassault Systèmes 3DEXCITE, sometimes helping out in other departments while picking up lots of private projects to avoid getting bored at home. <br>
                            In the future I probably won't be able to refuse interesting side projects either, be prepared to see some more "did a small project with this once" items getting added occasionally :) <br><br>
